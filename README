This repository contains source code to accompany 3D Slicer tutorial on developing extensions, see slides here: http://goo.gl/IP4cdg.

Each directory corresponds to the code at the time of completion of the corresponding part of the tutorial. The only file that is being modified is LineIntensityProfile/LineIntensityProfile.py. You can copy this file over to your development folder to "catch up" with the tutorial.

Questions/comments: see the feedback survey here http://goo.gl/vk31d1, or send email to fedorov@bwh.harvard.edu.
